# WM 2026 — FIFA World Cup 2026 Result Predictor

A machine-learning pipeline (in R) that predicts the outcome of FIFA World Cup
2026 matches and Monte-Carlo simulates the entire tournament. It learns from
~49,000 historical international matches, rates teams with an Elo system,
enriches features with Transfermarkt squad market values, and trains a
gradient-boosted classifier to estimate **P(home win) / P(draw) / P(away win)**
for every fixture. Those probabilities drive a full bracket simulation
(group stage → final) producing tournament-wide advancement and title odds for
all 48 teams.

A **live benchmarking dashboard** (GitHub Actions + Quarto, auto-updated daily)
tracks model accuracy against real WC-2026 results and runs a Quarter-Kelly
financial simulation against **real pre-match market odds** from The Odds API.

---

## Live dashboard

**https://vincent-rgb-cpu.github.io/WM_2026/**

Auto-updated daily at 07:00 UTC throughout the tournament. Two tabs:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **ML Metrics** | Calibration chart, per-match log-loss curve, model vs. baselines, tournament title odds (top 12) |
| **Financial Simulation** | Cumulative bankroll, return-per-bet bar chart, full match log with real Pinnacle/Bet365 odds and Kelly stakes |

---

## Results at a glance

Held-out evaluation on international matches from **2021 onwards** (the model
never sees them during training):

| Model                     | Accuracy | Log-loss | Brier |
|---------------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| **xgboost (this model)**  | **0.61** | **0.87** | **0.51** |
| Baseline: class priors    |   0.48   |   1.05   | 0.63  |
| Baseline: majority class  |   0.48   |  17.97   | 1.04  |

~61% three-way accuracy is realistic for international football (draws are
inherently hard to predict). Live WC-2026 accuracy is shown on the dashboard
and updated with every new result.

### Tournament odds (Monte-Carlo, N = 10,000)

| Team       | Win Cup | Make Final | Make SF | Make R16 |
|------------|:-------:|:----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Argentina  | 28.0 %  |   38.1 %   | 50.6 %  |  80.9 %  |
| Spain      | 13.5 %  |   27.3 %   | 39.6 %  |  70.4 %  |
| Brazil     | 10.7 %  |   18.4 %   | 35.3 %  |  73.9 %  |
| France     |  8.7 %  |   19.0 %   | 36.5 %  |  80.4 %  |
| England    |  7.0 %  |   12.5 %   | 29.2 %  |  73.6 %  |
| Portugal   |  5.3 %  |   11.8 %   | 20.2 %  |  67.4 %  |

Full results for all 48 teams are in `output/tournament_probabilities.csv` and
shown in the dashboard. The simulation is internally consistent: per-round
probabilities sum to exactly the number of slots (Win Cup = 100 %, finalists =
200 %, …).

> ⚠️ Elo-driven models concentrate probability on strong teams — top-team title
> odds run slightly higher than the betting market. Treat these as model
> estimates, not forecasts.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

- **R ≥ 4.1** with packages installed via `renv` (`make setup`)
- **Python 3.9+** for the SRF submission bot only (`make setup-python`)
- Optional: `ODDS_API_KEY` env variable for real market odds (free tier at
  [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com))

### R pipeline (stages 01 – 05)

```bash
make setup     # install R packages via renv (first run only)
make mv        # fetch Transfermarkt squad market values (cached 7 days)
make all       # stages 01–05: data → train → predict → simulate → scorelines
```

Or stage by stage:

```bash
Rscript scripts/01_build_dataset.R       # download + feature engineering
Rscript scripts/02_train_evaluate.R      # time-split evaluation + final model
Rscript scripts/03_predict_tournament.R  # per-fixture W/D/L + group simulation
Rscript scripts/04_simulate.R            # full Monte-Carlo (N = 10,000)
Rscript scripts/05_exact_scores.R        # Poisson xG → exact scorelines
```

### Benchmarking & real odds (stages 01b, 01c, 06)

```bash
# Fetch squad market values (Transfermarkt, 7-day cache)
make mv

# Fetch real pre-match h2h odds from The Odds API (1-day cache)
export ODDS_API_KEY=<your_key>
make odds

# Compute live accuracy metrics + Quarter-Kelly P&L simulation
make benchmark
```

The benchmark compares model predictions against actual WC-2026 results and
simulates betting using real Pinnacle (or best-available) closing odds. A bet
is only placed when:
1. Real market odds are cached for that match, **and**
2. `edge = model_prob − 1/real_odds ≥ 3 %`

### Local dashboard preview

```bash
make dashboard   # renders dashboard/index.qmd and opens it in your browser
```

### SRF Tippspiel automation (Python, local only)

The submission bot runs **locally only** — it uses interactive browser sessions
with your personal SRF login cookies. It is not part of the CI pipeline and
session credentials are never committed.

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies + Playwright browser (once)
make setup-python

# 2. Capture your SRF session interactively (once, or when it expires)
make login
#   → Opens Brave Browser. Log in to SRF, press ENTER in the terminal.
#   → Saves python_bot/srg_session.json (git-ignored — never commit this).

# 3. Submit predictions headlessly (auto-detects the open round)
make submit

# 4. Submit for a specific round using CDP interactive mode
make submit ROUND=4
#   → Checks if Brave is already running with CDP on port 9222.
#   → If not, prompts you to close Brave first, then launches it.
#   → Navigate to the correct round in the browser, press ENTER to fill cards.

# 5. Preview without submitting
make dry-run
make dry-run ROUND=4
```

### Fully automated local cron

```bash
# Test the full pipeline + submission manually first
make pipeline

# Then add to crontab (crontab -e):
0 * * * * cd /absolute/path/to/WM_2026 && bash run_pipeline.sh >> logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

## Data sources

| Purpose | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **Training data** | International results 1872–present ([martj42 mirror][hist], ~49k matches) |
| **WC-2026 fixtures & live scores** | `worldcup26.ir/get/games` (JSON API) |
| **Squad market values** | Transfermarkt national team pages (scraped via `scripts/01b_scrape_market_values.R`) |
| **Real pre-match odds** | [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com) — `soccer_fifa_world_cup`, `regions=eu`, `markets=h2h` |

Training data and market values are cached locally and git-ignored.
`data/raw/wc2026_fixtures.json` is committed to the repo as a CI fallback
(the fixtures host is geo-blocked from GitHub Actions runners; the committed
file is refreshed on every local run and keeps CI from failing).

## Modelling details

### Features

All features are computed *before* each match to prevent data leakage:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `elo_home_pre`, `elo_away_pre` | Pre-match Elo ratings (World-Football-Elo style with goal-difference multiplier) |
| `home_adv` | 1 for the WC-2026 co-hosts (USA, Canada, Mexico) in their home matches, 0 for all other WC fixtures (neutral venues) |
| `form_pts_diff` | Difference in rolling points over each team's last 5 matches |
| `form_gf_diff` | Difference in rolling goals-for over the last 5 matches |
| `form_ga_diff` | Difference in rolling goals-against over the last 5 matches |
| `rest_diff` | Difference in days since each team's last match |
| `log_mv_home`, `log_mv_away` | Log of total squad market value in EUR (from Transfermarkt, `NA` for teams without data — handled natively by XGBoost) |

### Algorithm

- **xgboost** multiclass (`multi:softprob`, 3 classes).
- **Recency weighting:** `exp(-decay × days_before_latest)` (~3.8-year half-life).
- **Time-based split:** train on pre-2021, evaluate on 2021-present — no
  random CV, which would leak future information.
- **Host nation advantage:** USA, Canada, and Mexico receive an Elo home
  bonus of +65 rating points in their WC group-stage matches (`neutral = FALSE`).
  All other WC fixtures are treated as neutral venues.

### Poisson scoreline model (stage 05)

Translates W/D/L probabilities into the exact scoreline format required by SRF:

- Symmetric GLM: `log(E[goals]) = α + β_att·elo_att + β_def·elo_def + β_home·is_home`
- Fitted on matches since 2010 (~15,000 matches, 31,000 scorer-rows) with
  the same recency weighting as the main model
- For each fixture: computes a 6×6 probability matrix (0–5 goals per side),
  selects the most-probable cell **that falls in the same W/D/L region**
  predicted by XGBoost — the two models are complementary

### Squad market values

`scripts/01b_scrape_market_values.R` fetches total squad market values from
Transfermarkt national team pages (HTTP with UA spoofing). Results are cached
for 7 days in `data/raw/squad_market_values.csv`. Market values are log-transformed
before entering the model (`log_mv_home`, `log_mv_away`) and are among the top-5
most important features after Elo ratings. Missing values (teams not in the
scraped list) are left as `NA` — xgboost routes them to the default split path.

### Full tournament simulation (stage 04)

- `TOURNAMENT_SIM_N = 10,000` independent bracket runs
- Group stage sampled and vectorised across all N runs simultaneously
- Tie-breaker: Elo proxy (points + Elo fraction), since the W/D/L model has
  no goal difference
- Third-placed qualification follows WC-2026 format (8 best from 12 groups)
- Bracket routing read from the official fixture API slot labels — no
  hand-coding required
- Knockout draws are resolved by redistributing the draw probability in
  proportion to each team's win odds

---

## Live benchmarking (stage 06 + dashboard)

`scripts/06_financial_benchmark.R` runs after every pipeline execution to
produce two output files that power the dashboard:

### `output/wc2026_match_log.csv`

One row per finished WC-2026 match, with:
- Model probability vector (`p_home_win`, `p_draw`, `p_away_win`)
- Proper scoring metrics: log-loss, Brier score, correct-prediction flag
- The real bookmaker used (`bookmaker`), decimal odds (`real_odds`), model
  edge (`edge = model_prob − 1/real_odds`)
- Kelly stake and P&L for that match

### `output/financial_benchmark.csv`

Cumulative bankroll time series (starting at 1,000 units), updated after every
bet. Bets are only placed when both a real odds cache entry exists **and**
`edge ≥ 3 %`. Stake = Quarter-Kelly fraction of current bankroll, capped at 10 %.

### Real odds pipeline

```
ODDS_API_KEY env var
        ↓
scripts/01c_fetch_real_odds.R
        ↓ (GET soccer_fifa_world_cup, regions=eu, markets=h2h)
The Odds API → selects Pinnacle odds (or best available bookmaker)
        ↓ (upsert cache — keeps finished-match odds after they leave the live feed)
data/raw/real_market_odds.csv
        ↓
scripts/06_financial_benchmark.R
        ↓ (left-join on home_team + away_team; skip match if no odds)
output/wc2026_match_log.csv
```

**Important timing note:** pre-match odds are only available in the API feed
*before* a match kicks off. The daily cron ensures odds are cached for
upcoming matches; the upsert strategy retains them after the match finishes
and disappears from the live feed. Matches played before the odds cache was
first populated will have no odds and will be excluded from the P&L simulation
(but their ML metrics are still recorded).

---

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` runs the full pipeline daily at 07:00 UTC
and on every push to `main` that touches R, scripts, or dashboard files.

### Steps

1. Restore renv library (cached between runs)
2. Install system dependencies (`cmake`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`, etc.)
3. Install dashboard rendering packages (`quarto`, `plotly`, `DT`, …)
4. Try to refresh `data/raw/wc2026_fixtures.json` via curl; fall back to the
   committed version if `worldcup26.ir` is unreachable from the runner
5. Fetch market values if not cached
6. Stages 01 → 05 (build → train → predict → simulate → scorelines)
7. Fetch real odds (requires `ODDS_API_KEY` secret in repo Settings)
8. Stage 06 — financial benchmark
9. Render Quarto dashboard with `quarto render dashboard/index.qmd`
10. Deploy rendered HTML to the `gh-pages` branch via `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`

### Required repository secret

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ODDS_API_KEY` | The Odds API key (free tier: 500 requests/month). Get one at [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com). If unset, the odds step exits cleanly and the benchmark runs without bets. |

### GitHub Pages setup

In your repo: **Settings → Pages → Source → `gh-pages` branch, `/ (root)`**.

---

## SRF Tippspiel bot

`python_bot/submit_tips.py` fills in your WC-2026 predictions on
[wmtippspiel.srf.ch](https://wmtippspiel.srf.ch) using Playwright.

**This bot is local-only.** It requires your personal SRF session cookies
(`python_bot/srg_session.json`) and interacts with a live browser — neither
of which belongs in CI.

### Two submission modes

| Mode | When to use | How it works |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Headless** (`make submit`) | Round is already open, page loads cleanly | Reuses saved session cookies, no browser visible |
| **CDP interactive** (`make submit ROUND=N`) | When you need to navigate to a specific round | Launches (or reuses) Brave Browser with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, you navigate to the correct round, then press ENTER |

### CDP flow (interactive mode)

1. Checks if Brave is already running with CDP on port 9222.
2. If not: prompts you to close Brave first, then launches it automatically.
3. You navigate to the correct round in the browser window until the match cards are fully loaded.
4. Press ENTER — the bot connects via Playwright CDP, finds the SRF tab by URL, waits for match cards, and fills all scores.

### Team name mapping

The SRF page uses truncated German team names (e.g. `Bosnien-Herzeg.` instead
of `Bosnien und Herzegowina`). The `EN_TO_DE` dictionary in `submit_tips.py`
maps our canonical English names to SRF's display labels.

---

## Limitations & possible next steps

- **No goal difference in the group-stage Monte-Carlo.** The Poisson model
  predicts scorelines (stage 05), but the simulator (stage 04) uses W/D/L
  for speed. Integrating Poisson draws would give proper GD tie-breakers.
- **Third-place routing** uses a valid bipartite matching, not FIFA's exact
  published permutation table — a negligible difference in aggregate probabilities.
- **Elo-driven concentration.** Title odds for favourites run above the
  betting market because strength enters mainly through Elo across seven rounds.
- **Group matches are re-sampled** even if already played; finished results
  feed Elo ratings but are not pinned. Conditioning on known results is an
  easy refinement.
- **No player-level data** (injuries, line-ups, suspensions).
- **Retroactive odds gap.** Matches played before the odds cache was first
  populated have no real market odds and are excluded from Kelly simulation.
  As the tournament progresses and the daily cron runs, this gap shrinks.
- **SRF CSS selectors** (`div.scoreBet`, `input.scoreBet__pick__number`, etc.)
  were confirmed against the live site on 2026-06-14. If SRF updates their
  frontend, re-inspect with DevTools and update the `SEL_*` constants in
  `submit_tips.py`.
